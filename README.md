# Portfolio

This is the source code for my temporary portfolio.
I am too afraid to make any changes to the normal repository, since it's getting evaluated, so here is a new repository.
Feel free to look around!

## Running this

```bash
# This installs the dependencies
npm install

# The website gets automatically opened
npm run dev -- --open
```
